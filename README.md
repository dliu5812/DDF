# Decompose to Adapt: Cross-domain Object Detection via Feature Disentanglement


In this project, we proposed a Domain Disentanglement Faster-RCNN (DDF) for cross-domain object detection, from the view of feature disentanglement.

The implementations are for our paper published in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia:

[Decompose to Adapt: Cross-domain Object Detection via Feature Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01929)


**The overall code will be released later on.
